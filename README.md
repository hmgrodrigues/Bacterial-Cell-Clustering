# Bacterial-Cell-Clustering

The goal of this project is to examine a set of bacterial cell images using Machine Learning techniques, including Feature Extraction, Feature Selection and Clustering Algorithms.

The images/ folder has 563 PNG images taken from a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy photograph of Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of hospital infections and often resistant to multiple antibiotics.

## Clustering Algorithms

You can check how each Clustering Algorithm grouped the dataset in the following files:

* **test_kmeans.html** (K-Means)
* **test_db.html** (DBSCAN)
* **test_agg.html** (Agglomerative)
* **test_bisK.html** (Bissecting K-Means)
